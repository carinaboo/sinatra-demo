# sinatra-demo

## To Start Server

1. Run `gem install sinatra` to grab the sinatra library code so your files can reference to it.

### Developing Locally
2. Run `ruby app.rb` from your project directory in terminal.
3. Hit your server by going to the URL [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) in your browser (or whatever port number it says it's running on; by default it is `4567`).

### Developing on Cloud9
2. Run `ruby app.rb -p $PORT -o $IP`.
3. When your server is up, Cloud9 will pop up with a URL for the server (e.g. mine was `https://demo-carinaboo.c9users.io/`)
